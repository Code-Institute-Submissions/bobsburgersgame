**Websites responsiveness**
---------------------------------------

Website responsive layout was primarily tested on Google Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi using the Developer Tools. 
The website also worked well with Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox.
The website also works well with smart devices.

**Bugs and Problems**
One notable bug I came across was the flip animation to show the front face of the card was not working on iPhones. 
I fixed this problem by using webkits.

Automated checks
================

I used the W3C's Validators to check my HTML and CSS code. I did this three ways, here are the steps I took.

>**HTML**
>![image](README_files/images/html-checker.png)
>**CSS**
>![image](README_files/images/css-checker.png)

1. **Using the websites URL address to check the HTML code**

>1. Go to https://validator.w3.org and select the URI tab. 
>2. Enter https://liamoconnor87.github.io/bobsburgersgame/index.html into the address bar and click **Check**.
>3. Confirm that no errors or warnings show. 
![image](README_files/images/urlindex.png)
Do the same for each page. 
>4. Enter https://liamoconnor87.github.io/bobsburgersgame/level_two.html into the address bar and click **Check**.
>5. Confirm that no errors or warnings show.
![image](README_files/images/urllvl2.png)
>6. Enter https://liamoconnor87.github.io/bobsburgersgame/level_three.html into the address bar and click **Check**.
>7. Confirm that no errors or warnings show.
![image](README_files/images/urllvl3.png)

2. **Using the websites URL address to check the CSS code**

>1. Go to https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and select the URI tab. 
>2. Enter https://liamoconnor87.github.io/bobsburgersgame/ into the address bar and click **Check**.
>3. Confirm that no errors show - 2 notable warnings show for webkits used to make the animation work on apple devices. 
![image](README_files/images/urlcss.png)

I used JShint to validate my Javascript code. Here are the steps I took. 

**JS**
![image](README_files/images/jshint-checker.png)

3. **Input directly to check JS code.**

>1. Go to the repository - https://github.com/liamoconnor87/bobsburgersgame
>2. Click on the **assets** link.
![image](README_files/images/assets-folder.png)
>3. Click on the **scripts** link. 
![image](README_files/images/scripts-folder.png)
>4. Click on the **animations.js** file link. This should take you to animations.js page displaying the code. From here you can highlight all the code and copy it. 
![image](README_files/images/js-code.png)
>5. Once copied, go to https://jshint.com.
>6. Paste the code from the animations.css file in to where instructed.
>7. Validation works automatically, confirm no errors.
![image](README_files/images/anijs-input.png)
>8. Repeat process for **game.js** file.
![image](README_files/images/gamejs-input.png)
>9. Repeat process for **sounds.js** file.
